* simple dom snippets (%haml or slim or jade are nice)
* true dom manipulation using simple api
* dom renders with zero extra spaces. no indentation or newlines
* dom renders attributes with expanded booleans, all values double-quoted, self-closing tags closed
* easily render a snippet from full dom for ajax requests
* populate and extract data Ã  la plates
* works on client and server with no modifications

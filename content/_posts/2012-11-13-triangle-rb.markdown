## Design, Behavior, Development

Presented by Caleb Wright ([@calebwright](https://twitter.com/calebwright)) from Fabrik Agency. Event details are at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/events/87139422/).


### We are builders, not designer or developers

* Humans like to compare
  * we think we're good at it...
  * but we're not (apples vs oranges versus apples vs cars)
* Designing how to think can nudge users down a path
* Sell the do, not the what


### Other resources

### TL;DR

I was distracted because the speaker was reading the slides as written. He presented his slides directly from [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/calebwright/design-plus-behavior-plus-development), so I stopped taking notes. You can go through the his slides to get an idea of what he was talking about.
